    "RSA is a method for exchanging information between two parties without any potential third party intercepting and stealing the exchanged information. RSA maintains this security by taking a message and encrypting it via a series of FME calculations that hide the message behind encryption values. These messages are then able to be transferred securely between the desired parties without unwanted interruption or theft of this information. \n",
    "\n",
    "For RSA to work, it makes use of several algorithms that increase the efficiency of the program as well as makes use of number theory concepts on the way to achieving our resulting encrypted messages. RSA encryption requires the use of a particular encryption key, *e*, that is selected with prior understanding of particular number theories of modular arithmetic, including prime relativity, the Euclidean Algorithm, Bezout's Theorem, Fermat's Little Theorem, the Chinese Remainder Theorem, and Fast Modular Exponentiation. After publishing my public encryption key, *e*, and a modulus, *n*, consisting of two prime factors, *p* and *q*, others may encode a message in the form *M^e mod n*, where each character *M* is converted to a numeric code in ASCII that is then passed through this function and converted to an encrypted value. After receiving these encrypted messages, I possess a decryption key, *d*, that will invert the original function, returning the original message.\n",
    "\n",
    "For my project, I show a fun way for exchanging messages between classmates by providing my public key to others to encrypt messages for me to read, where I then reverse this process using a decryption key, the inverse of the encryption function, to read the messages sent to me. I also incorporate a main function displaying a user interface for a user to easily navigate the process of encryption, including extra tools for flexibility. (i.e. instead of just following the steps 1 -> 2-> 3 -> 4 -> 5, I offer manual entry and resetting of keys to allow for the user to simply encode and decode if they wish)"

We encode a message, *C* in the form $$ C = M^{e}  (mod n)$$\n",

Encoding FME was a tricky process because I had to think about how I was acquiring my exponential increments differently, and converting either the base or the exponent to binary is a neat means of accomplishing this task.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Extended Euclidean Algorithm was also a challenge. Much of acquiring the Bezout linear representation of two integers done by hand involves running through the EA once, and then working backwards to acquire the linear representation with appropriate coefficients. But the algorithm we designed keeps track of coefficients by switching out old ones with newly calculated ones. Another problem I ran into with this algorithm was picking out the inverse of the public key. For a time, I was pulling the incorrect coefficient, forgetting that I designed my algorithm in such a way to return the correct coefficient every time, as well as modifying it in such a way in the event it was negative.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because my public key algorithm randomly selects an appropriate e to use, it was increasingly important that I maintain organization of my keys and messages. I made errors including posting incorrect ciphers with mismatched keys because I didn't keep track of the appropriate *e* keys. \n",

    "\n",
    "I wasn't sure what I wanted to do with my custom feature at first. The __main__ feature didn't make sense to me at first, especially as it was something I had never done before, and the tutorials didn't indicate right away the purpose of them. I had some help to guide me along (Thank you Abdullah A), and I was excited to find that the main function essentially serves as a UI for my program! I had fun putting together prompts and weaving together the code I had previously written into something more akin to programs as we know and use them. I'm proud of my progress and that I've further learned something new about using Python. \n",
    "\n",
    "One thing I noticed about the way my main function is designed is that I would normally copy my functions into a separate file and import them into the primary program to cut down on clutter. Since this is a Jupyter notebook, I've omitted this step, but acknowledge it with comments in my code. One challenge I had was in decrypting the message, since I forgot that it would be initialized as a string and that I had to convert it to a list of integers first before my decoding function would work.\n",
    "\n",
    "I had a fun time designing the user interface for my program. I thought about several potential errors that could occur and did my best to predict and troubleshoot as many as could come. Since I try to keep in mind the \"average user\" for my program, there are bound to be several ways in which a user could break my program (and there still are!) I threw in some extra functions for flexibility purposes, such as manually entering public keys for the purpose of solely encrypting a message, and also for resetting values when new ones need to be generated.\n",
    "\n",
    "If I had more time to improve my main function, I would want to incorporate Pollard's Rho for my factorizing function. Since I was flip flopping on whether to use a main function, I started exploring Pollard's Rho and thought the concept of it was very interesting, and is something that I would like to venture into further in my free time. I found an algorithm for it, but have not used it since I don't entirely know how it works yet. But it exploits the fact that at least one factor of n is less than or equal to the square root of n, and then does a neat recursive method (Tortoise and Hare) to find two values whose difference is divisible by the factor. Overall, the algorithm is much more successful than the brute force one I've used. Another improvement I would make is to incorporate \"profiles\" using Python's OOP and Classes. This way, a user could instantiate a class object of a user profile containing their public and private keys so that it would make switching between the people you communicate with much easier, rather than having to manually enter public keys and resetting them constantly. e.g. Encode a message to Dr. Stade using her public keys, and decrypt the messages she sends me with my public and private keys that I've saved under her profile.\n",
    "\n",
    "If I could grade myself on the custom feature, I'd award myself 10 points. It's not the fanciest main function ever, the UI feels somewhat clunky for what it is, and there's plenty of ways to break the program. We are our own biggest critics, but I feel I learned something new and challenged myself to build upon something more extraordinary than I've ever thought to do on my own, and I had fun creating something that, should the parameters be obeyed, just about anyone could use. There's still so much more I could build upon with what I've started and I would like to revisit these ideas again. \n"
